# RPaladinDamage
Simple World of Warcraft 1.12 Paladin Average DPS Estimation based on current stats and weapon skills assuming target has nightfall debuff and 0 armor. This also assuems you use Judgement of Command R5 constantly and excludes Exorcism and Consecration due to their mana inefficiency, although the use of Exorcism Rank 1 is advantageous to Vengeance upkeep it is too situational and therefore left out.
